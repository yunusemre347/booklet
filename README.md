# booklet<p>
                I was going to use this on my personal portfolio page. Then i
                changed my mind since this is too catchy and not nice to look
                at. So i stopped working on it. Thats why there are some little
                bugs.
                *Book doesnt correct itself when you dont scroll and use
                  next/prev buttons. 
                *Hello page appears too early contrary to
                  later pages which works just fine
              
                 These are not very hard things to solve and i will solve them later. I am just working on something else right now
